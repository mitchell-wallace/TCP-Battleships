✔ Set player numbers correctly @done(22-10-18 20:22)
    If contacted is set true in Broadcast, playernumber is set to 2
    If set to true in OpponentConnection, playernumber is set to 1
✔ Place ships randomly @done(22-10-18 20:48)
✔ Actually start game for both players @done(22-10-18 21:01)
✔ how do we not dispose tcpStream?? @done(22-10-19 12:55)
✔ Implement fire, hit messages @done(22-10-19 14:38)
☐ Implement SUNK function
☐ Fix shot mapping on opponent grid
✔ Have players actually fire at each other @done(22-10-19 14:38)
✔ Improve random placement @done(22-10-19 12:04)
☐ Verify / fix separation of concerns
    Only UserInterface should care about input validation
    Only GameGrids should care about the contents of a cell; GetCell should not be needed externally
☐ Fix delays with startup -- primarily, host being slow to break the loop
    ☐ THEN change the wait timer to 30 seconds as required by assignment spec
☐ Why can't the WSL version ever be player 2??
☐ Change ship hits to X's -- lowercase just isn't all that noticeable
    >> ACTUALLY let's do this with colours!!!:
    You can set Console.BackgroundColor. Possible colours:

--- ok so the stuff below this line is basically wrong ---

Run OpponentConnection.ListenAsHost() as a loop!

impelement TCP
    obtain IP address from received UDP packet, without breaking stuff

manually set TTL to 128, Exclusive Address Use to false
